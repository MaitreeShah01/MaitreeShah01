**üìà Projects That Showcase My Work**

1. [Sales Performance Analysis:](https://github.com/MaitreeShah01/Salse-analysis)

   Created an interactive sales performance analysis tool using Python and Tableau. Programmatically generated synthetic sales data that incorporated actual trends. Created dashboards    to illustrate critical KPIs, including regional sales maps, combined bar and line charts for revenue trends, bubble charts for salesperson performance, and animated cumulative         sales trends over time. Dynamic filters and parameters were used to improve interactivity, allowing for actionable insights and data-driven decision-making.

2. [Expense Tracker Application](https://github.com/MaitreeShah01/Expense-Tracker-App-):

   The Expense Tracker is a Python-based application designed to simplify expense management. It features secure user authentication, allowing users to track and categorize their         spending, analyze expenses through visual charts, and export data to CSV for record-keeping. The project employs SQLite for database management, bcrypt for secure passwords, and       libraries like pandas and matplotlib for analysis and visualization. This modular and scalable project highlights skills in Python, database design, and data visualization.
